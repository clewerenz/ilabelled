# General Information

ilabelled was developed to address a fundamental problem in labeling values in R: 

  1. Underlying values should not be changed when value labels are added (as is the case with the factor class). 
  2. Value labels as well as underlying values should be able to be used as indices. 

In addition, the i_labelled class should encourage users to think directly about meta information about variables in the work process and add it to the variables.

The basic idea behind this endeavor is to enable a similar handling of survey data as is the case in common social science statistical software such as SPSS or STATA.
